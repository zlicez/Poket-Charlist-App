# External APIs

This skill provides access to external APIs through Replit-managed
passthrough billing. Requests are proxied through OpenInt with
managed credentials.

## Recommended workflow

1. Open the connector reference for request and response details.
2. Call `externalApi__<connector_name>` from `code_execution`.
3. Use `query` for URL parameters and parse `result.body`.
4. For media URLs, save files under `attached_assets/` and present them.

## Available APIs

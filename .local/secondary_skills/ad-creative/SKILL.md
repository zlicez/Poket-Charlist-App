# Ad Creative Maker

Design static ad creatives for social media ads, display banners, and digital advertising campaigns. Build production-ready ads via the design subagent and present them as iframes on the canvas.

## When to Use

- User needs ad creatives for Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google Display, or TikTok
- User wants banner ads or display advertising assets
- User needs multiple ad variants for A/B testing
- User wants ad copy and visual design together
- User wants to iterate on ad creative based on performance data

## When NOT to Use

- Organic social media content (use content-machine skill)
- Video ads or animated content (use storyboard skill for planning)
- Full landing pages (use the `artifacts` skill)

## Image-First Design Philosophy

**Every ad should be built around a striking, full-bleed generated image.** The image IS the ad — text is overlaid on top, not placed in a separate zone. This produces the punchy, scroll-stopping aesthetic that performs on modern social feeds.

**Always generate images** using `generateImage` from the media-generation skill unless:

- The user uploads/attaches their own product photos or brand imagery
- The ad is purely typographic by explicit request
- The platform is text-only (e.g., Google RSAs)

**Image style direction:** Photorealistic, editorial, dramatic. Think fashion magazine meets Apple product launch. Single striking subjects, dramatic studio lighting, dark/moody backgrounds, high contrast. Avoid: abstract digital art, generic stock photo aesthetic, flat illustrations, busy compositions. Each image should have one clear focal point that makes someone stop scrolling.

**Prompt strategy for generated images:**

- Lead with a specific, tangible subject (object, scene, or person)
- Specify lighting style (studio, dramatic, golden hour, Rembrandt)
- Specify camera quality ("shot on Hasselblad," "editorial photography," "fine art")
- Add negative prompts: "text, words, letters, logos, watermark, blurry, low quality, cartoon, illustration"
- Each ad in a set should use a *different* visual metaphor — same brand, different visual world

## Default Format

**Default to square (1:1)** for ad creatives. Use portrait/iPhone format (9:16, iframe size 608×1080) when:

- User asks for Instagram Stories or Reels ads
- User asks for TikTok ads
- User mentions "mobile ads," "iPhone," "portrait," or "stories format"
- User asks for 9:16 or vertical format

## Methodology

### Step 1: Creative Brief

Gather these inputs:

- **Platform & Format**: Which platform? (Google Ads, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok, X/Twitter) Which format? (Search RSAs, feed, stories, display)
- **Objective**: Awareness, consideration, or conversion?
- **Target audience**: Who will see this ad? What stage of awareness? (Problem-aware, solution-aware, product-aware)
- **Key message**: Single most important thing to communicate
- **CTA**: What action should the viewer take?
- **Brand assets**: Logo, colors, fonts, product images. If the user hasn't provided their actual logo, note this and ask at the end.
- **Performance data** (if iterating): Which headlines/descriptions are performing best/worst? What angles have been tested?

### Step 2: Platform Specifications (2025-2026)

**Enforce these programmatically.** Count characters in code, don't eyeball.

#### Meta (Facebook/Instagram) — Visual

| Placement | Dimensions | Safe zone (keep critical elements inside) |
|---|---|---|
| Feed (square) | 1080×1080 | ~100px margin all edges |
| Feed (portrait) — **preferred** | 1080×1350 (4:5) | 4:5 outperforms 1:1 on CTR; mobile-first |
| Stories | 1080×1920 | Top 14% (270px) + bottom 20% (380px) = dead zones |
| Reels | 1080×1920 | Top 14% + **bottom 35% (670px)** — like/comment/share UI is taller |
| **Universal safe core** | **1010×1280 centered** | Design inside this box → works everywhere |

Upload at 2x pixel density (2160×2160 for a 1080 slot) for Retina sharpness. JPG/PNG, 30MB max.

**20% text rule: officially removed** — Meta no longer rejects text-heavy images, but the delivery algorithm still quietly throttles them. Keep text minimal; move details to primary text.

#### Meta — Text

| Element | Limit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Primary text | 125 chars visible feed / **~72 chars visible in Reels** | Write for 72 |
| Headline | 40 chars rec | Below image |
| Description | 30 chars rec | Often hidden on mobile |

#### Google Ads

**Responsive Search Ads (RSA):**

| Element | Limit | Qty | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Headlines | 30 chars | up to 15, min 3 | Each must work standalone — Google combines randomly |
| Descriptions | 90 chars | up to 4, min 2 | Complement, don't repeat headlines |
| Display path | 15 chars × 2 | — | |

Pin sparingly — pinning drops Ad Strength and limits ML optimization. Supply ≥5 headlines + ≥5 descriptions for ~10% more conversions at same CPA.

**Responsive Display Ads (RDA) — default Display format:**

| Asset | Spec | Qty |
|---|---|---|
| Landscape image | 1200×628 (1.91:1) | up to 15 total |
| Square image | 1200×1200 (1:1) | required |
| Portrait image | 1200×1500 (4:5) | optional, expands inventory |
| Logo square | 1200×1200 (128 min) | up to 5 |
| Logo wide | 1200×300 (4:1) | optional |
| Short headline | 30 chars | up to 5 |
| Long headline | 90 chars | 1 |
| Description | 90 chars | up to 5 |

All images ≤5MB, JPG/PNG only (no GIF in RDA). Keep file size <150KB for fast load.

**Highest-inventory static sizes** (if uploading fixed banners): 300×250 (medium rectangle — most served, works desktop+mobile), 728×90 (leaderboard), 320×50 (mobile banner), 300×600 (half-page — premium CPM, high CTR), 336×280.

**Performance Max:** same asset pool serves across Search/Display/YouTube/Gmail/Maps/Discover. Upload all 3 image ratios + a YouTube video (≤30s) or Google auto-generates one — don't let it.

#### LinkedIn Ads

| Element | Limit |
|---|---|
| Intro text | 150 chars rec (600 max) |
| Headline | 70 chars rec (200 max) |
| Image | 1200×627 (1.91:1) or 1200×1200 |

#### TikTok Ads

1080×1920, 9:16. Ad text: 100 char max (~80 visible). For Spark Ads (boosting organic creator posts), get the authorization code from the creator — Spark Ads outperform In-Feed Ads on engagement because they retain organic engagement metrics.

#### X / Twitter Ads

| Placement | Dimensions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Single image | 1200×675 (1.91:1) or 1080×1080 (1:1) | 1:1 gets more real estate in feed |
| Carousel cards | 1080×1080 (1:1) or 800×800 min | 2-6 cards; each card gets its own image + optional headline/URL |
| Portrait (organic or promoted) | 1080×1350 (4:5) | Taller images dominate mobile feed; 4:5 works for organic posts promoted via Amplify/Quick Promote |

| Element | Limit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tweet text | 280 chars | ~100 chars visible before "Show more" on mobile when media is attached |
| Card headline | 70 chars | Below image on website cards; not present on carousel image cards |

**Carousel strategy:** Each card should be a self-contained visual — assume viewers swipe through quickly. Use carousels to show multiple visual worlds, product angles, or sequential narrative. High-performing carousels often use a **consistent structural layout** (same typography placement, same logo position) with **varying visual treatments** per card, so the brand stays recognizable while each card feels fresh. This creates a "same but different" effect that rewards swiping.

### Step 3: Determine Campaign Mode

Before defining angles, determine whether this is a **direct-response** or **awareness/launch** campaign. The approach differs significantly.

#### Awareness / Launch Campaigns

Use for product launches, brand announcements, event teasers, or top-of-funnel awareness. These prioritize mood, intrigue, and brand impression over clicks.

**Key differences from direct-response:**

- **No CTA button on the image.** The ad is a statement, not a prompt. The CTA lives in the post text or link, not the visual.
- **Even less text: ~10-15 words max** on the image — typically just brand name, one positioning line, and a date or tagline.
- **Visual metaphor over product shots.** Don't show the product. Use evocative imagery that communicates the brand's feeling or aspiration (e.g., a person in nature for "freedom," a glowing device for "future," a flower for "beauty/craft"). The imagery should make someone stop scrolling because it's beautiful or intriguing, not because it promises a specific outcome.
- **Multiple visual worlds per campaign.** For carousels or multi-asset campaigns, create 3-5 distinct aesthetic treatments — different color palettes, different photographic subjects, different moods — while keeping typography layout and logo placement consistent. This "same structure, different world" pattern rewards swiping and creates brand depth.
- **Layout pattern:** Logo (top corner) → Hero visual (fills most of the frame) → Brand name / headline (bottom, large, bold) → Subtitle + date (smaller, below headline).

**When to use awareness mode:**

- Pre-launch teasers and announcements
- Brand-building campaigns where the goal is recall, not clicks
- Event promotion (dates, countdowns)
- When the user says "announce," "tease," "launch," or asks for something that "looks premium" without conversion goals

#### Direct-Response Campaigns

Use for conversion, lead generation, app installs, purchases. This is the default mode — most ad requests are direct-response.

### Step 3b: Define Angles (Direct-Response)

Before writing individual copy, establish 3-5 distinct angles — different reasons someone would click:

| Category | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Pain point | "Stop wasting time on X" |
| Outcome | "Achieve Y in Z days" |
| Social proof | "Join 10,000+ teams who..." |
| Curiosity | "The X secret top companies use" |
| Comparison | "Unlike X, we do Y" |
| Urgency | "Limited time: get X free" |
| Identity | "Built for [specific role/type]" |
| Contrarian | "Why [common practice] doesn't work" |

### Step 4: Design Principles

#### Direct-Response Visual Hierarchy

**Read order:** 1) Hero element → 2) Benefit/offer → 3) CTA → 4) Logo (corner, small).

**Rules:**

- <20 words total on the image — move everything else to primary text
- One focal point. If the eye doesn't know where to land in 0.5s, it's too busy.
- High contrast text/background — verify WCAG 4.5:1 minimum (use `chroma.contrast()` if building programmatically)
- CTA button: contrasting color, rounded corners, verb-first ("Get the guide" not "Learn more")
- Faces looking *toward* the CTA increase click-through (gaze cueing)
- Keep file <150KB for display; Meta accepts up to 30MB but slow loads hurt auction performance

#### Awareness / Launch Visual Hierarchy

**Read order:** 1) Hero visual (dominates the frame) → 2) Brand name / headline (large, bold, bottom or mid-frame) → 3) Positioning line (smaller, beneath headline) → 4) Logo (top corner, subtle).

**Rules:**

- ~10-15 words max on the image. The visual does the heavy lifting.
- No CTA button. The image is a brand impression, not a click prompt.
- Use photography, 3D renders, or AI-generated imagery — not stock graphics, icons, or wireframes. The hero should feel editorial or art-directed.
- Visual metaphor over literal representation. Show a feeling, not a feature. A glowing screen = innovation. A person with outstretched arms = freedom. A flower = craft/beauty. The viewer should feel something before they read anything.
- Logo adapts to background: white logo on dark backgrounds, dark logo on light backgrounds. Keep it small and corner-positioned — it brands without competing with the hero.
- For carousel/multi-card: maintain identical text layout and logo position across cards. Vary only the hero visual and color palette. This "same frame, different world" structure creates visual rhythm that rewards swiping.
- Typography should be bold and confident — large headlines that anchor the bottom of the frame. Lowercase or sentence-case can feel more modern and approachable than ALL CAPS.

### Step 5: Generate Variations

For each angle, generate multiple variations. Vary:

- **Word choice** — synonyms, active vs. passive
- **Specificity** — numbers vs. general claims ("Cut reporting time 75%" beats "Save time")
- **Tone** — direct vs. question vs. command
- **Structure** — short punch vs. full benefit statement

**Strong headlines:** Specific over vague. Benefits over features. Active voice. Include numbers when possible ("3x faster," "in 5 minutes").

**Strong descriptions:** Complement headlines, don't repeat them. Add proof points, handle objections ("No credit card required"), reinforce CTAs.

### Step 6: Validate and Deliver

Before presenting, check every piece against character limits. Flag anything over and provide a trimmed alternative. Include character counts.

```text

## Angle: [Pain Point — Manual Reporting]

### Headlines (30 char max)

1. "Stop Building Reports by Hand" (29)
2. "Automate Your Weekly Reports" (28)
3. "Reports in 5 Min, Not 5 Hrs" (27)

### Descriptions (90 char max)

1. "Marketing teams save 10+ hours/week with automated reporting. Start free." (73)
2. "Connect your data sources once. Get automated reports forever. No code required." (80)

```

### Step 7: Build Ad Creatives — Design Subagents + Canvas

**Launch a separate design subagent for each variation in parallel** using `startAsyncSubagent`. Each subagent builds one ad variation as a standalone HTML page. This is much faster than building them sequentially.

#### Canvas Layout

**Square (1:1) — default:** Use 1080×1080 iframes. Group by angle in rows, with a landing page iframe alongside:

```text
x=0,    y=0:    [Iframe: angle1-ad]              (1080x1080)
x=1200, y=0:    [Iframe: angle1-landing]         (1280x720)
x=0,    y=1180: [Iframe: angle2-ad]              (1080x1080)
x=1200, y=1180: [Iframe: angle2-landing]         (1280x720)
```

**Portrait (9:16) — for stories/mobile/Instagram/TikTok:** Use 608×1080 iframes. Arrange in rows of 5 with 50px gutters:

```text
Row 1: x=0, x=658, x=1316, x=1974, x=2632  (y=0,    each 608x1080)
Row 2: x=0, x=658, x=1316, x=1974, x=2632  (y=1130, each 608x1080)
```

#### Parallel design subagent delegation

**Launch all variations simultaneously.** Each subagent gets one ad + its landing page. Use `startAsyncSubagent` for each, then `waitForBackgroundTasks` to collect results.

**Before launching subagents**, generate all hero images first using `generateImage`. Each ad needs its own unique, photorealistic hero image. Save them to `artifacts/mockup-sandbox/public/images/` and reference them in the component via `/__mockup/images/[filename].png`.

```javascript
// Step 1: Generate all hero images BEFORE launching design subagents
// Use generateImage from the media-generation skill
// Save to artifacts/mockup-sandbox/public/images/ad-[name].png
// Each image should be a different visual metaphor — same brand, different world

// Step 2: Launch design subagents in parallel — each builds one ad component
await startAsyncSubagent({
    task: `Create a production-ready ad creative component for the following angle.

Brand: [name]
Colors: Primary [hex], Secondary [hex], Accent [hex]
Fonts: [display font] (load from Google Fonts or use Inter)
Logo: [SVG description or path to uploaded logo]
User's stated style preferences: [include any specific preferences]

**Angle: [Pain Point]**
- Hero image: \`/__mockup/images/ad-[name].png\` (already generated — use this exact path)
- Headline: "[headline text]"
- Subtext: "[optional short line]"

Build this file: [ComponentName].tsx in artifacts/mockup-sandbox/src/components/mockups/[folder]/

**CRITICAL — Image-first full-bleed layout:**
The generated photo IS the ad. The component must use this exact structure:

\`\`\`
Outermost div: width: 100vw, height: 100vh, overflow: hidden, position: relative
Hero image: <img> with position: absolute, inset: 0, object-fit: cover, width: 100%, height: 100%
Bottom gradient overlay: position: absolute, bottom: 0, width: 100%, linear-gradient(transparent, rgba(0,0,0,0.7))
Text on top of gradient: position: absolute, bottom section
All font sizes in vw units (8-12vw for headlines in square, 8-20vw in portrait)
\`\`\`

Design rules:
- The hero image fills the ENTIRE frame — no margins, no panels, no colored backgrounds
- Text overlaid directly on the image with gradient for readability
- Headlines: HUGE, bold (font-weight 900), vw units
- Minimal text: brand name + one headline + one short subtext max
- Logo: small, top corner, SVG
- Use text-shadow for extra readability on busy backgrounds
- The vibe: if you saw this in your Instagram feed, you'd stop scrolling`,
    specialization: "DESIGN",
    relevantFiles: ["artifacts/mockup-sandbox/src/components/mockups/[folder]/[Component].tsx"]
});

// Repeat for each angle — all launch simultaneously
// Wait for all to complete
await waitForBackgroundTasks();
```

After all subagents finish, embed each page as an iframe on the canvas using `apply_canvas_actions`. Tell the user what was created and offer to focus the viewport.

#### Styling rules — no exceptions

- **Viewport-relative sizing.** All ad HTML must use `100vw`/`100vh` for the container and `vw`-based font sizes/padding. Never fixed pixel dimensions for the ad container. The ad must fill whatever iframe it's placed in without clipping or scrollbars.
- **Image-first layout.** The generated hero image fills the entire frame (`position: absolute; inset: 0; object-fit: cover`). Text is overlaid on the image using a bottom gradient (`linear-gradient(transparent, rgba(0,0,0,0.8))`). No separate text panels, no side-by-side layouts, no colored backgrounds behind text. The image IS the ad.
- **Bold, massive typography.** Headlines should be huge — 8-12vw for square, 8-20vw for portrait. Font weight 900 (black). Use `text-shadow` for readability against busy backgrounds. Headlines should feel like they *belong* on the image, not pasted on top.
- **Minimal text.** Brand name, one headline, one short subtext line max. Move everything else to the platform's text fields. If you can remove a word, remove it.
- **No decorative gradients in direct-response ads.** Use flat, solid colors for any non-image elements. Exception: the bottom readability gradient over the hero image is always allowed. Awareness/launch ads may use dramatic lighting, glows, and atmospheric gradients when they serve the visual metaphor.
- **Match the concept.** If the user said "minimalist," don't add decorative elements. If they said "bold and energetic," don't make it muted. Re-read the user's stated preferences before delegating.
- **Consistency across angles.** All angles should feel like they're from the same brand — same fonts, same color usage patterns, same visual language. The angles differ in message and hero image, not in design system. For awareness carousels: consistency means same text layout and logo placement, but each card can inhabit a completely different visual world (different photography, different color temperature, different mood).
- **Landing page = real page.** The mock landing page should look like where the ad actually leads — hero section echoing the ad's message, value props, testimonials/social proof section, and a CTA. Not a wireframe, not a placeholder.

#### Export

The user can screenshot each iframe directly, or open the HTML files in a browser at the desired export size. Since the ads use `vw`/`vh` sizing, they'll adapt to any viewport. For batch export at specific dimensions: `npx playwright screenshot angle1-ad.html --viewport-size=1080,1080`.

## Iterating from Performance Data

When the user provides performance data:

1. **Analyze winners**: Identify winning themes, structures, word patterns, and character utilization in top performers (by CTR, conversion rate, or ROAS)
2. **Analyze losers**: Identify themes that fall flat and common patterns in underperformers
3. **Generate new variations**: Double down on winning themes, extend winning angles, test 1-2 new unexplored angles, avoid patterns from underperformers
4. **Document the iteration**: Track what was learned, what's being tested, and what angles were retired

## Research Before Writing

Use `webSearch` to find examples of top-performing ads in the user's vertical. Search for ad breakdowns, swipe files, and case studies — e.g. `webSearch("[industry] top performing Facebook ads 2026")` or `webSearch("[industry] TikTok ad examples")`. The TikTok Creative Center and Meta Ad Library are useful reference sites but require direct browser interaction to filter; web search can surface articles and analyses that reference their data. Reverse-engineer: what hook, what angle, what visual pattern. Don't guess what works — look it up.

## Common Mistakes

- Writing RSA headlines that only work in sequence (Google combines them randomly — each must stand alone)
- Ignoring the Reels 72-char visible limit (writing for the 125-char feed limit → truncated on Reels)
- All variations = same angle reworded (vary the *psychology*, not the synonyms)
- Placing text in the bottom 35% of a 9:16 ad (covered by UI on every platform)
- Retiring creative before 1,000+ impressions per variant
- Letting Performance Max auto-generate video — always supply your own
- Putting a CTA button on awareness/launch ads (these should create intrigue and brand recall, not push for immediate clicks — the CTA belongs in the post text)
- Using the same visual treatment for every card in a carousel (each card should be a different visual world; if they all look the same, there's no reward for swiping)
- Showing literal product screenshots in a launch teaser (before launch, use visual metaphors that communicate the brand feeling — save product shots for post-launch conversion campaigns)
- Defaulting to direct-response design when the goal is awareness (a launch announcement needs mood and mystique, not a "Sign up now" button)
- Building ads with CSS-only backgrounds instead of generated images (the image IS the ad — always generate photorealistic hero imagery unless explicitly told not to)
- Placing text in a separate panel next to the image (text goes ON TOP of the image with a gradient, not beside it)
- Using abstract digital art or generic "tech" imagery (go editorial: real objects, dramatic lighting, tangible subjects)
- Forgetting to prompt the user for their real logo at the end

## Post-Build: Logo Prompt

After delivering the ad creatives, **always check whether the user has provided their actual logo**. If they haven't (i.e., you used a placeholder SVG or described the logo in code), end your response with a plain-text note like:

> "If you'd like to swap in your real logo, just upload or attach it and I'll drop it into all the ads."

This is a simple text reminder — not a tool call, not a modal, just a natural closing line. Skip this if the user already provided their logo file.

## Limitations

- Cannot run or measure ad campaigns
- Cannot access ad platform analytics
- Cannot create animated or video ads
- Image generation requires the media-generation skill
